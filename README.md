- 👋 Hi, I’m @NetterNE 
- 👀 I’m interested in Network(Routing & Switching/Data Center/VPN) and M5stack MCU.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cloud computing and New language.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Neuro-sama (ネウローサマ) is an independent English-speaking VTuber who streams on Twitch.
                Her most remarkable feature is that she is not a human streamer herself,
                but rather a complex of programs emulating a human streamer using artificial intelligence.
